### Project Highlight
For my multipage web development project, I created a comprehensive website consisting of 4–10 web pages, centered around a state of my choice. This project was carried out step by step for a client as follows:

**Step-by-Step Project Breakdown**:

1. **Main Page and Additional City Pages**:

I began by designing a main page that introduces the chosen state, serving as the entry point for visitors.,<br/>
Following this, I developed additional pages dedicated to the state capital and two other notable cities within the state. Each city's page contains specific information:<br/>
- **Population**: Current population data.
- **Incorporation Year**: The year the city was officially incorporated.
- **Region**: The geographical region within the state where the city is located.
- **Classification**: Whether the city is urban, suburban, or rural.
- **Average Income Level**: How the city's income level compares to the state average.
  
2. **Essential Elements on Each Page**:

- **HTML Titles**: Each page has a title in the head section, reflecting its specific topic.
- **Relevant Images**: Each page includes an image related to the content, complete with alternative text for accessibility.
- **Navigation Menu**: A consistent navigation menu is present on all pages, allowing users to easily move between different sections of the website.
  
3. **Semantic HTML Elements**:

- **Header**: Contains introductory content relevant to the document or a section of it.
- **Navigation (nav)**: Includes links to all other pages within the site.
- **Section**: Displays the main content of the page.
- **Aside**: Provides additional information related to the main content.
  
4. **Additional Website Features**:

- **External Link**: Included a link that opens an external website in a new tab using the target="_blank" attribute.
- **Ordered List**: An HTML-coded ordered list with at least three items.
- **Unordered List**: An HTML-coded unordered list with at least three items.
- **HTML Table**: A table with 3–6 columns and 3–6 rows to organize information systematically.

5. **External CSS File**:

- **Text Styles**: Applied styles for text, including a specific font-family.
- **Hover Effect**: Used a :hover pseudo-class for navigation buttons to create a rollover effect.
- **Float Property**: Positioned at least one element to the side of another using the float property.
- **Positioning**: Implemented both absolute and relative positioning in at least one section of the page.
- **Selectors**: Element selector to style general HTML elements. Class selector used multiple times to style specific HTML elements. ID selector to format particular elements uniquely.

6. **Form Creation**:

- Added a form on one of the website's pages that includes:<br/>
- Text fields for first name, last name, email address, and email confirmation.<br/>
- A text box for users to submit questions.<br/>
- Placeholders in all fields for user guidance.<br/>

7. **JavaScript Validation**:

Ensured the email confirmation field matches the initial email entry through JavaScript code.

9. **Website Deployment**:

Uploaded the entire website to a hosting service, ensuring it included:<br/>
- All HTML pages.<br/>
- External CSS documents.<br/>
- JavaScript file. <br/>
- All relevant images.<br/>
By meticulously following these steps, I developed and deployed a fully functional, informative, and user-friendly website that showcases various aspects of the selected state and its cities.
